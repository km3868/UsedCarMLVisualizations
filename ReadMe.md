### About the Project
This project was completed for DSCI 631, Applied Machine Learning, Fall 2022, Professor Wang @ Drexel University.

#### Dataset
The dataset was obtained from Kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ananaymital/us-used-cars-dataset
Because the dataset is 10gb, it was randomly sampled and split into 3 files, each file ~950mb:
- _Part_00_, _Part_01_, _Part_02_

Because of the size of the 3 files and availability of the original dataset, only the pre-processed parquet file below will be available within the project folder.
- _data_parquet.parquet.snappy_

The jupyter notebook 'G7_FinalProject.ipynb' contains all necessary packages to work with the dataset assuming it is run on Google colab. Local installation and requirements are not within the scope of this project and users will need to configure hardware and software to work with the packages used therein.
